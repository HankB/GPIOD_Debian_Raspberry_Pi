# GPIOD_Debian_Raspberry_Pi

Explore GPIOD on Raspberry Pi running Debian Linux

## Motivation

Recent explorations demonstrate that Debian (not Debian based Raspberry Pi OS - R-Pi OS) runs well on the Pi Zero and Pi 3B+. One question regarding this is the usability of GPIO which is one of the useful capabilities of the Raspberry Pi.

The library previously used was [WiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/) and which seems to be languishing. It's been set aside by its original developer and what seems like the [most popular fork](https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi) has not received an update in nearly a year. Along with looking at GPIO on the Pi, this project will use `gpiod` to explore GPIO including both shell commands and C/C++ programs.

## Status 

Work in progress

CLI examples provided.
